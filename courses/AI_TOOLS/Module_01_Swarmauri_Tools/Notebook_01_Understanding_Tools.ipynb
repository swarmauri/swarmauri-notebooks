    "In the GenAI course, we saw how Large Language Models (LLMs) independently perform reasoning and generate responses whenever a user prompts them. While this functionality is powerful, there are scenarios where we may want to extend the LLM's capabilities, customize its behavior, or integrate it with external systems. This is where **tools** come into play.  "

    "Tools, in the context of LLMs, are external functionalities or modules that extend the capabilities of the model. They act as \"helpers\" that the LLM can invoke to perform specific tasks, retrieve data, or execute actions beyond its native reasoning ability.  \n",

    "- **Calculators:** For performing mathematical computations.  \n",
    "- **APIs:** For retrieving real-time or domain-specific data (e.g., weather, stock prices, translations).  \n",
    "- **Databases:** For searching, updating, or managing structured data.  \n",
    "- **Custom Code:** For executing domain-specific logic or workflows.  "

    "1. **Static Knowledge:** LLMs trained on fixed datasets cannot provide up-to-date information or handle real-time data.  \n",
    "2. **Limited Precision:** For certain tasks like mathematical calculations or technical workflows, tools ensure higher accuracy.  \n",
    "3. **Customization:** Tools allow developers to tailor the LLM's behavior to specific use cases, industries, or problems.  \n",

    "1. **Dynamic Context:** When the task requires real-time information retrieval or updates (e.g., fetching live sports scores or news).  \n",
    "2. **Complex Operations:** When precise or domain-specific calculations are required (e.g., financial analysis, engineering computations).  \n",
    "3. **Automation:** For workflows involving external systems, APIs, or task automation (e.g., booking tickets, sending emails).  \n",
    "4. **Data Integration:** When the model needs to interact with external databases, vector stores, or APIs to access structured information.  "
