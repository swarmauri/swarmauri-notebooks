    "## Key Concepts in Swarmauri\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **SDK Overview**\n",
    "Swarmauri SDK is a toolkit designed to help you create scalable AI-driven systems. It includes advanced NLP tools, data chunkers, embeddings, and integration capabilities for working with large language models (LLMs) and document retrieval systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Document Loaders and Chunkers**\n",
    "- **Document Loaders**: Load and parse large datasets for processing.\n",
    "- **Chunkers**: Break down documents into smaller, manageable pieces, making it easier for AI models to work efficiently on large-scale data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Document Parser**\n",
    "One of the key features of the Swarmauri package is the Document Parser. This tool is designed to process and extract meaningful information from various types of documents,text files, and other structured or unstructured data formats.\n",
    "- **Text Extraction**: It can extract text from supported file formats efficiently.\n",
    "- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: The parser processes text in a format that is ready for downstream NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis or entity recognition.\n",
    "- **Flexible**: Supports multiple formats and can be easily extended to handle custom document types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **LLM Integration**\n",
    "Seamless integration with various LLMs allows Swarmauri to be used in a wide range of AI-driven projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Vector Stores and Retrieval**\n",
    "- Vector databases help with efficient storage and retrieval of embeddings and AI model outputs.\n",
    "- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines real-time data retrieval with model inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, you'll get hands-on experience with each of these tools. As you go through the following modules, you'll explore:\n",
    "- Setting up your environment.\n",
    "- Building basic agents.\n",
    "- Optimizing document processing.\n"
