    "\n",
    "Each LLM Tool class in **Swarmauri** provides the following methods for interacting with the models. These methods are designed to offer flexibility for both **synchronous** and **asynchronous** workflows, as well as batch processing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`predict`**:  \n",
    "   - **Description**: This method allows you to interact with the LLM in a synchronous (blocking) way.  \n",
    "   - **Use Case**: When you need immediate results for a single input.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`apredict`**:  \n",
    "   - **Description**: The asynchronous counterpart of `predict`. It allows you to interact with the LLM without blocking the program.  \n",
    "   - **Use Case**: When running multiple tasks concurrently using `asyncio`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`stream`**:  \n",
    "   - **Description**: Enables streaming responses from the LLM synchronously. This is useful for real-time text generation.  \n",
    "   - **Use Case**: When you want to process or display results as they are generated.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`astream`**:  \n",
    "   - **Description**: Asynchronous streaming of responses. It allows you to stream responses without blocking the program.  \n",
    "   - **Use Case**: For real-time streaming in an asynchronous environment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **`batch`**:  \n",
    "   - **Description**: Allows you to process multiple inputs at once in a synchronous manner.  \n",
    "   - **Use Case**: When you need to send a batch of requests for efficiency.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **`abatch`**:  \n",
    "   - **Description**: Asynchronous version of the `batch` method for processing multiple inputs concurrently.  \n",
