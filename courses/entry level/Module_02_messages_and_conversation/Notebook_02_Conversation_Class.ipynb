    "The `Conversation` class is a concrete implementation of the `ConversationBase` class in the `swarmauri` framework. It represents the structure and functionality required to manage conversation history and interactions within the framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose in `swarmauri`:\n",
    "- The `Conversation` class is used to handle and structure conversations between users and tools or models in the `swarmauri` framework.\n",
    "- It allows for:\n",
    "  - **Adding Messages**: Storing inputs (e.g., user prompts or messages) into the conversation history.\n",
    "  - **Context Management**: Maintaining the history of a conversation, which is critical for tools or language models that rely on context to generate meaningful responses.\n",
    "  - **Interfacing with Toolkits**: Facilitates smooth integration with toolkits and models to generate responses or perform specific actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This class acts as a foundational piece in building conversational AI applications or systems within the `swarmauri` framework, enabling robust and contextual interactions.\n",

    "1. **`HumanMessage`**: Represents user input, such as questions, commands, or requests.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`AgentMessage`**: Represents the assistant's response, typically generated by an AI model or tool.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`FunctionMessage`**: Represents tool-generated responses or outputs. For example, data retrieved from a web service or computation results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`SystemMessage`**: Represents system-level instructions or guidelines for the conversation. For instance, defining behavior or context for the AI.  \n",

    "- **Building Conversational AI**: Use it to manage interactions between users and AI models, ensuring coherent and context-aware responses.\n",

    "- **Custom Applications**: Ideal for applications requiring a structured and extensible conversation framework.\n",
