    "\n",
    "Swarmauri is divided into four main components:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **swarmauri_core**: Defines the core ABC classes, essential for maintaining structure and consistency.  \n",
    "2. **swarmauri**: The main SDK, built on `swarmauri_core`, and used for building AI applications.  \n",
    "3. **swarmauri_community**: Includes additional features like vector databases and integrations.  \n",
    "4. **swarmauri_experimental**: A space for testing new, unstable features. Once stable, they are moved to `swarmauri` or `swarmauri_community`.  "

    "## Features of Swarmauri  \n",
    "---  \n",
    "\n",
    "The Swarmauri SDK is built with modularity and reusability in mind, offering pre-defined functions and tools organized into key modules.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To navigate Swarmauri, follow this general pattern:  \n",
    "```python  \n",
    "from swarmauri.<resource_kind>.<concrete>.<module> import <specific_class_or_tool>  \n",
    "```  \n",
    "For example:  \n",
    "```python  \n",
    "from swarmauri.llms.concrete.OpenAIModel import OpenAIModel  \n",
    "from swarmauri.tools.concrete.AdditionTool import AdditionTool \n",
    "```  \n",
    "\n",
    "Swarmauri provides a wide variety of subtypes across its modules, making it flexible for diverse AI tasks. Here are just a few examples:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **`swarmauri.utils`**: Includes utility functions for common operations like logging or data formatting.  \n",
    "- **`swarmauri.tools`**: Offers pre-built tools such as `AdditionTool` for arithmetic tasks.  \n",
    "- **`swarmauri.llms`**: Features various pre-integrated models, including `language models`, `vision models`, `audio models`, and `image generation models`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "With Swarmauri, you can easily explore and import the tools or models you need, making AI development streamlined and efficient.  "
