    "## Environment Setup  \n",
    "---  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install Python**:  \n",
    "   Ensure that Python 3.10 or above is installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/).  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:  \n",
    "   This is not a must but creating a virtual environment is a good practice to keep your project dependencies isolated from the base system Python environment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Recommended**: We suggest using conda for this so go ahead and download Anaconda Navigator from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download).  \n",
    "   - **Alternative**: Use `venv` if Conda is not an option.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create a New Environment for Swarmauri**:  \n",
    "   Open a terminal and run the following command:  \n",
    "   ```bash  \n",
    "   conda create --name swarmauri-env python=3.10  \n",
    "   ```  \n",
    "   - Replace `swarmauri-env` with any name you prefer.  \n",
    "   - Ensure Python 3.10 or higher is specified.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Activate the Environment**:  \n",
    "   Run the following command:  \n",
    "   ```bash  \n",
    "   conda activate swarmauri-env  \n",
    "   ```  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Add the Environment as a Jupyter Kernel**:  \n",
    "   If youâ€™re using Jupyter for development, you can add the environment as a kernel:  \n",
    "   ```bash  \n",
    "   conda install -n swarmauri-env ipykernel  \n",
    "   python -m ipykernel install --user --name=swarmauri-env --display-name \"Python (swarmauri-env)\"  \n",
    "   ```  \n",
    "   - This will make the environment available in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab as \"Python (swarmauri-env)\".   "
