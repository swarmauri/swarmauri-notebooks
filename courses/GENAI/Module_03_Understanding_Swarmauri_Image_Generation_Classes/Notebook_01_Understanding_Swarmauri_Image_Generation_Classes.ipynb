    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **`generate`**:  \n",
    "   - **Description**: This method allows you to generate images synchronously (blocking).  \n",
    "   - **Use Case**: When you need immediate results for a single image generation request.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`agenerate`**:  \n",
    "   - **Description**: The asynchronous counterpart of `generate`. It allows you to generate images without blocking the program.  \n",
    "   - **Use Case**: When running multiple tasks concurrently using `asyncio`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`batch`**:  \n",
    "   - **Description**: Enables processing multiple image generation requests at once in a synchronous manner.  \n",
    "   - **Use Case**: When you need to generate a batch of images for efficiency.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`abatch`**:  \n",
    "   - **Description**: Asynchronous version of the `batch` method for processing multiple image generation requests concurrently.  \n",
    "   - **Use Case**: When you need to process a batch of image generation tasks in an asynchronous environment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike LLM classes, **Image Generation** classes do not support `stream` or `astream` methods, as images cannot be streamed incrementally while being generated. This streamlined method set ensures an intuitive experience tailored to the unique requirements of image generation workflows."
