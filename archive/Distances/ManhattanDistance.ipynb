    "In this notebook, we'll explore how to use the `ManhattanDistance` class from the swarmauri SDK to calculate the Manhattan distance between vectors. The Manhattan distance, also known as the L1 norm or taxicab distance, measures the absolute difference between the coordinates of two points. This metric is particularly useful in machine learning, data analysis, and computer vision, where it provides a simple yet effective way to measure differences or similarities between data points.\n",
